# Portfolio website

My personal portfolio website [here](https://lyfing.fr).

## Built with
- HTML5 / CSS3
- SASS
- Vue.js and Vue CLI 4

# Requirements
- Node 14

## Optmizations
- HTML pages are pre-rendered (thanks to the [`prerender-spa-plugin`](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/prerender-spa-plugin)) during the build process since it's a static websites and imo using a server-side prerender framework (like Nuxt) may have been to overkill. The statics files are deployed and served by Nginx.
- Scores >90 on Lighthouse for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.
